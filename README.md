## Subjects not listed

During some courses we had projects that weren't stand alone apps but rather parts of prefilled frameworks. I don't own any right to these frameworks. Due to this I won't publish source codes of these projects.
* IAL - Algorithms
    - sorting and searching methods, queues and stacks
* IZG - Computer Graphics Principles
    - displaying of 2D and 3D object, filling them etc.
